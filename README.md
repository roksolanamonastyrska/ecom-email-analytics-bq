# ecom-email-analytics-bq

**This project focuses on building an analytical dataset based on an e‑commerce database in BigQuery, along with a dashboard in Looker Studio. The goal is to create a unified dataset that enables:**

- analysis of account creation dynamics,
- tracking email activity (sent, opened, clicked),
- evaluating user behavior by key categories such as send interval, account verification, and subscription status,
- comparing activity across countries and identifying top-performing markets.

The final result is a consolidated dataset generated with a single SQL query, containing both account-level and email-level metrics, along with country-level aggregations and rankings.
